# Giumag PDF — AI Project State

Last bootstrap audit: 2026-09-12

Current verified `main` baseline: `6a78003791218267ac539789a2835970623f9c5f` (Phase 0 merged through PR #30)

This file records current durable development state. It is not a chronological project log. Re-verify repository state at the start of every session.

## Current objective

Evolve the public Web/PWA beta from a technically solid 18-tool toolkit into a product that feels deliberate, coherent, polished, accessible and maintainable while preserving the privacy-first/local-first model and protecting document integrity.

Current beta priorities remain those defined by `docs/BETA_OPERATIONS.md`: privacy/security, output correctness, regressions, crashes/compatibility, accessibility, usability, then polish and new features.

## Current product state

- Public Web/PWA beta is live at `https://giumag-pdf.pages.dev`.
- Current beta line: `0.21.0-beta.x`.
- Root package version at the bootstrap audit: `0.21.0-beta.1`.
- 18 primary tools are exposed as available through shared metadata in `packages/shared/src/index.ts`.
- Web client: React + TypeScript + Vite + PWA.
- Desktop shell: Tauri.
- Mobile shell: Capacitor.
- PDF processing is designed to remain local/on-device.
- Heavy operations use workers where appropriate.
- PDF.js and Tesseract runtime assets are intentionally synchronized locally.
- The public repository has issue forms, beta triage rules, security guidance and a protected `main` workflow.

## Completed foundations relevant to current work

- Shared Web/Desktop/Mobile architecture established.
- Public Web/PWA beta published.
- 18-tool Web/PWA surface available.
- PDF-engine regression tests exist for multiple high-risk capabilities.
- Privacy/security and beta operations documentation published.
- Contribution and pull-request workflow documented.
- Public beta issue triage structure established.

## Current phase

### Phase 1 — Home information architecture and UX

Phase 0 AI continuity bootstrap was integrated into `main` through PR #30.

Current bounded task: make the homepage primary PDF-opening entry point describe what it actually does without presenting Giumag PDF as only a page organizer.

Scope:

- use generic "Apri un PDF" wording;
- explain that this entry opens the page-view/organization workspace;
- point users to the tool catalog for other operations;
- preserve existing behavior and local processing.

Out of scope:

- routing;
- tool-registry refactors;
- CSS architecture changes;
- PDF-engine changes.

## Next planned step

After this bounded copy/IA change is reviewed and integrated, evaluate the next homepage discoverability improvement using the current 18-tool catalog and beta evidence. Keep it separate from routing and registry consolidation.
## Known technical debt / future work

### Home / client dispatch

`apps/client/src/App.tsx` currently duplicates tool knowledge across:

- `ActiveWorkspace`;
- workspace component imports;
- a large tool-ID switch;
- shared `UNIVERSAL_TOOLS` metadata.

This is a valid later registry-consolidation target, not part of the bootstrap.

### Durable tool URLs

The client currently selects workspaces through React state and has no routing dependency. Durable tool URLs should be evaluated later with PWA, refresh, Cloudflare Pages and offline behavior treated as constraints.

### CSS maintainability

`apps/client/src/styles.css` was approximately 288 KB at the bootstrap audit. Decompose incrementally by logical region; do not combine a mass CSS migration with a major redesign.

### Performance

Existing build notes mention large chunks and PDF-engine import warnings that are non-blocking unless they cause reproducible user-visible failures. Measure before introducing code splitting or lazy loading.

## Protected choices

- Local-first/privacy-first processing is non-negotiable unless explicitly superseded by a durable project decision.
- Preserve the accepted Web + Tauri + Capacitor distribution architecture in `docs/DECISION.md`.
- Preserve shared platform-neutral tool metadata in `packages/shared`; client-specific components and routing/loading mappings belong in the client layer.
- Prefer incremental CSS evolution over a styling-framework rewrite.
- Do not add new PDF tools merely to increase tool count during beta stabilization.

## Unresolved product questions

- Does beta usage show that the generic PDF-opening flow needs more than the current direct page-view/organization workspace?
- Which tools, if any, should be featured above the full catalog?
- Are categories/search justified by actual catalog density and beta feedback?
- When durable tool URLs are introduced, is a small native solution sufficient or is a router dependency justified?
- What are the safest first boundaries for incremental `styles.css` extraction?

Resolve these from current code, rendered behavior and beta evidence rather than assumptions.
